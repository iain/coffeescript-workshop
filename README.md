# CoffeeScript Workshops

This is part of the javascript/coffeescript workshops, given on 2011-11-01 and 2011-11-09 by
[Iain Hecker](http://iain.nl) at [Finalist](http://finalist.nl).


## Installation

First, clone this repository.

To make things easier, I've included a script to get you up and runnig.

### Ubuntu

If you're running on Ubuntu, simply run:

    ./install.sh

### OS X

You'll need development headers (through Xcode), python and curl.

If you're using Homebrew, it's probably best to install Node.js via that.

    brew install node

After that, resume normal installation:

    ./install.sh

### In a Virtual Machine

I've also included possibility to install it in a VM.

Install [Ruby](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then
run:

    gem install vagrant
    vagrant up

This will take a lot of time the first time, because it will download Linux and compile Node.js.

Login to your freshly created VM:

    vagrant ssh

Go to the project directory:

    cd /vagrant

From here you can run the rest of the scripts.

If you're done, don't forget to shut down the VM with `vagrant halt`.


## Running specs

Run the specs of a sample project:

    jasmine-node --coffee DIRECTORY

So the example specs (to see if everything installed correctly):

    jasmine-node --coffee example

It has one passing spec and one failing spec. Try fixing it as a first exercise.
